## Introduction Slide

As Computer Science and Software Engineering majors, we often never have to think about how data is physically represented - especially in transit.

Engineers have kindly abstracted away a painful amount of trigonometry and magnetism for us.

All we have to worry about is a small box at the bottom of the OSI model that says "Physical Layer".

In reality this means all sorts of different things.

Unfortunately, our friendly little 1s and 0s have turned into sine waves.

Learning the listed modulation techniques from a software perspective often requires demotivating amounts of math.

Some people dedicate their entire career to the field of digital signal processing.

## Title Slide

This is why I propose Kazooformation, an engaging data representation model.

## The New Physical Layer

This project is based on two opinion based assumptions:

1. DSP and information theory are inherently boring
2. Kazoos are not boring

Ultimately, the goal of this project is to create an engaging and accessible
modulation scheme model. Kazooformation promotes educational accessibility.

## Project Features

As a proof of concept of this new modulation teaching tool, a software system will be implemented that can encode and decode data into kazoo sounds.

On top of a translation layer, there will a chat client, that facilitates text communication via kazoo based audio.

This allows user to text back and forth across a room or via a voice chat using nothing but kazoo sounds.

Along with this, a tar like utility that converts files to and from kazoo wav files.

If there is time I'll create simple kazoo executables.

## Kazoo Modulation Diagram

This is done by encoding data as a series of kazoo sounds.

For example, a high pitch kazoo sound could represent a 1, and low pitch a 0.

Unfortunately, for audible signals, this scheme would be limited to about 200 bits per second.

I need to be able to differentiate between as many different kazoo symbols as
possible.

The challenge is that Kazoo sounds are already incredibly noisy signals, which is going to make this a challenge.

## Technical Resources

In summary, the only way that I can convince others that these topics are interesting is by making it more fun.
