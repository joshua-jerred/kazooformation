# Final Presentation Outline

## Introduction - 20s (00:20)

Hello everyone,

My name is Joshua Jerred, I'm a Computer Science student here.

I am currently working at Miller Electric as an Embedded Software Engineer
in a Co-Op position and I plan to work there full time after graduating.

...

Today I'd like to talk to you all about kazooformation.

## The Problem (Problem Description) 30s (00:50)

Information theory and signal analysis are confusing and intimidating topics.

This leaves the pysical layer of the OSI model as an exercise for the reader,
even though software solutions exist down there.

I've implemented a few simple modulation and demodulation libraries in the past.
I think they're really neat, but it has been a challenge to explain them to others as most of the core concepts are obfuscated
by big words and triganometry.

## The Solution

### S1

This is where the kazoo comes in.

With a little bit of bluring the lines between what is possible and what is reasonable, I've created a physical layer that you can hear and feel, focusing on core intuition over textbook teaching.

### S2

I created a software library that translates any serialized data to
and from kazoo sounds using various kazoo models.

Because it's just an abstract physical layer, this could
be used for anything.

### S3

As an example of this abstract, here is a visualization of the ASCII letter `H` being
translated into kazoo signals.

...

> Volume all the way up, unmuted

It might not be audible to people in the other room, but this is what it sounds like

> Play `H`

These signals can be used either live via a users microphone and speakers or
they can be stored as audio files for later decoding.

## S4

As an example application of this library I created a barebones chat client on top of it.

## Describe the Features of the Solution

KTL C++ Library

Kazoo Connect is a simple application example of the library

## Describe any interesting architecture or algorithmic features of your solution

Model System
- Bit-Width agnostic
- in effort to fill 

http server

## Describe any possible future plans

- Moving past kazoo sounds

## Lessons Learned

Translating to kazoo sounds was easy, translating from kazoo sounds was hard. It doesn't matter how loud your screaming if nobody is listening.
